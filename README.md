# Lowerthird-casparcg-template-bodymovin
This is a lower third template example for CasparCG. 
The animation is exported from After Effects with bodymovin plugin(ver. 5.9.6), and then played in the html template with lottie player(ver. 5.10.1).

In this repo there are 2 examples, the only differens between them are the json files, the bodymovin plugin exports.
